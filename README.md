### Hi there üëã I'm Chris Scheppele! (he/him)

I have a BA in Psychology & Spanish from Oklahoma State University.  While I never worked in the field after graduation, the knowledge served me well through my career in customer service.  You meet so many people serving and bartending but you never get to hang out with the friends you make in those fields because there is always the barrier between you and them because you are doing a job and by default, if they are there when your working, you simply have schedules that don't match.  I decided I wanted to find a new direction which allowed me to enjoy my time with the great people I had met so far in my life.  I already had a love for gaming, math, and languages so, to me, looking into a career in the software development just made sense.  That has led me to where I am now, an accomplished full stack developer who enjoys time with friends and designing games in my free time!

- üåç I currently live in Barcelona, Spain but will be returning to the united States in Mid-August.  I am open to working anywhere with a good tech industry but have particular interest in Denver, Austin, or San Diego in the United States or abroad in Spain, Australia, or New Zealand.  I prefer hybrid work environments.  Having a dedicated work space and fostering connections with team members is important to me but I also enjoy the schedule flexibility and ability to have a day to yourself without extra interruptions.
